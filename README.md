---> This read me is probably different than a lot of them out there. 
I've never considered coding until I knew this is what the world is built upon now. 
I want to forever change the way we greet one another. 
From the simple wave of a hand to a greeting card, there are thousands of ways to say hello and goodbye. 
But it's the words between that, hello and goodbye that define our connections and how we approach new and current ones. 
My poetry-based software would open up the valley in-between hello and goodbye, to always be continuing conversation.
